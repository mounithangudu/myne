What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a repository is created but no commits are created yet. once a commit is created, all the changes can then be tracked. We need a repository to track the changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
not sure yet.
