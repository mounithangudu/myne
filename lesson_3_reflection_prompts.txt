When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To coloborate with other people and also being able to work on multiple computers in work and at home.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There will be a lot of clones which makes it very confusing for others to view your clone changes.
