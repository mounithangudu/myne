How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because we will have a control of the mistakes we do in the future and the edits we do in the future

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

when we commit, we have an control of the versions but sometimes we mightnot understand when to commit and it becomes difficult and we can observe it only when we need it. 
google dos on the otherhand may creat multiple copies which we are not intrested in and sometimes may creat less than required if we code fast.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
google docs assumes that each file is independent of others, so there is no need to save all the versions everytime. and It is unnecessary. While in coding, we use different files which are interconnected. If we change a specific file and change the the corresponding connected files, we need all the changes to be seen together so that we can correct them together in the future.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
we first use git log to find out the changes and identify the changes and use git diff to pinpoint the changes made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

by using version control, we can easy get back to a previous state without any editing in case we do mistakes in future documents.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
WE can use it to build complicated softwares
